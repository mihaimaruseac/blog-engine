:construction: This will get changed :construction:

This is the source code for [my personal blog][blog]. It uses [Hakyll][hakyll]
and [Haskell][haskell].

The name is a [Sindarin word][elvish] meaning *mist thread*/*rope*. It is
chosen based on the fact that the blog is a collection of interwoven threads
of articles.

This is a personal project, not an official project of my employer (Google).
